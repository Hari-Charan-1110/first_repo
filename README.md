My name is Haricharan Sakhinana.
I am from Visakhapatanam, Andhra Pradesh.
I studied in Sri Chaitanya School and College.
I like to explore new places,travel, find hidden spots and other exciting stuff.
I like to watch movies also.

I liked the interface of git.I also liked it when another tab opened if i type help.Other languages give a lot of output below the command making it harder to follow, but git opened a tab.
This is something i liked very much in git as far as i have seen its applications.

I liked the problem of collatz chaotic path generator question.It was an interesting sequence.
